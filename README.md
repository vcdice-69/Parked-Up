### Project Description
Parked Up is a web application that helps drivers in Singapore find available parking lots in real time, reducing the time they spend searching for carparks. Our application uses data from data.gov.sg APIs to provide carpark information and their real-time parking lot availability.<br /><br />
Upon opening the app, carparks around Singapore are displayed on a map as “bubbles”, with numbers in them representing the number of available lots. Users can toggle between Map View and List View, and click on carparks to view more details. They can also search for carparks by address, and apply filters to only view carparks that fit their requirements. Users can also sign up for an account to save carparks for easy access to the carpark’s info and directions.<br /><br />
Parked Up aims to improve users’ daily commute and parking experience, and help to create a more efficient and driver-friendly city.
